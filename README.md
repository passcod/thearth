# ThEarth

_SlimerJS script to take a screenshot of the earth as seen from "geostationary
orbit" on Google Maps, right above NZ, with the sun+shadow up-to-date._

Run with [SlimerJS](https://slimerjs.org). PhamtomJS won't work.

Example:

![The Earth above NZ, as of writing](https://github.com/passcod/thearth/raw/master/earth-20160401T031950Z.png)
